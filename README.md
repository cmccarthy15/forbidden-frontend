# Planning Notes
- Tiles on backend
- Arrangements on backend... best way to hold? stringified array of values for rows and for columns, randomized and assigned to tiles as game gets created
- Games have one arrangement, and many tiles via GameTiles that include their row and column number, and smoe kind of status? 
- Need to grab images 
- Add wave visual while they're going underwater!!!LK@J#RL@J#RIP@#OJR(PI@#R)
